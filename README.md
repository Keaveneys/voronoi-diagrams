# voronoi-diagrams
An example of a diagram type used to show how 'dominance' of control over the penalty box can be visualised.

The details found in this repository are a replication of the work sourced from Soccermatics' brilliant tutorials on how to make the most out of football data analysis.

The Voronoi diagram partitions a plane into a collection of polygons. Each polygon contains just one generating point and every point in a polygon is closer to the polygon than any other generating point. More information on Voronoi diagrams can be found here:

In football, Soccermatics identified a great use case: utlise Voronoi diagrams to understand the 'control' a team has over a particular space at any given time; a penalty box when a shot is taken, for example.
